## Introduction

This program is used to evaluate the effect of database change to client connections, including both long and short connections.

It does 2 things:
- Creates some long connections and pings the database in each connection periodically. It reports an error when ping fails or takes too long.
- Creates short connections periodically. It reports an error when creating connection fails or takes too long.

## Usage

```shell
go build
./connect "root:12345678@tcp(127.0.0.1:4000)/test" 100
```

The last argument indicates the number of long connections.
